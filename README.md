# Feed-me

## Description
Feed-me is a web-based, mobile-friendly application where fellow gastronomes can share or browse photos of various epicurean delights. We have created a specialized social media platform with a nod and a wink to Instagram utilizing many of the same technologies, including; like, follow, comment, and direct-message capabilities. We have also implemented multiple back-end algorithms to filter content and suggest accounts to follow based on mutual contacts and interests.
